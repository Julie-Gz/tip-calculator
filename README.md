This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This challenge is incomplete.
Here are some of the issues I encountered:

-I couldn't get the function to calculate as the numbers are being entered in the bill, tip, and number of 
people fields. I kept getting NAN as it was trying to calculate even when no data was being entered.
After many attempts at trying to change that I decided to add a caluclate button that will only start the
calculation when it's clicked which brings us to the next issue
-I added an event listener to the calculate button but I keep getting the error
"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')" and I still haven't found 
issue.

I will continue to come back to this challenge until I have fully solved it. Any help and tips are much 
appreciated but this is as far as I can go, for now.
